One of my graduate student coworkers posted a couple of super-interesting articles about machine learning earlier this week, and it motivated me to find a decent platform with which to blog.  Jekyll has all the bells and whistles I want right now _(I'm not looking to one-up [Steve][acko])_, so we'll see how long I stick with this before finding something shiny.

So…I guess…hello, world.
